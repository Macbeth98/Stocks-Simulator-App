Steps to run the JAR file:

1. The Assignment6 JAR file requires one of two command line options to be passed, i.e, 
        - 'gui': to run the GUI version of the application.
            Ex:
                java -jar Assignment6.jar gui
        
        - 'text' to run the text based interface version of the application.
            Ex:
                java -jar Assignment6.jar text

        - PLEASE NOTE: If no option is passed, a warning is displayed and the GUI will be rendered by default.
        I.e, the following will render the GUI.
            Ex:
                java -jar Assignment6.jar
